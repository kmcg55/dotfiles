### dotfiles
My personal configuration files for vim and zsh. A work in progress as I become comfortable with more shells, terminal emulators, and determine which plugins I actually "need." Maybe switching from iTerm2 to Kitty in the future. 

### Dependencies
Relies on [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) for zsh plugins and [Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for vim plugins

### Usage
Clone repo, open bash and run `./setup.sh`
